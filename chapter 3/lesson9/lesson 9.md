# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

- Example


```
print(10 + 5)
```
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

-   Arithmetic operators
-   Assignment operators
-   Comparison operators
-   Logical operators
-   Identity operators
-   Membership operators
-   Bitwise operators


### Python Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
|       Operator name          |     Name                   |example
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|+|Addition            |x + y||
-         |Subtraction   |x - y
| *         |Multiplication |x * y|
| /|Division |x / y
|%      |modulus |x % y
|**          |Exponentiation| x ** y
|//         |Floor division |x // y


### Python Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

|       Operator name          |     Name                   |example
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|==|Equal            |x == y||
!=         |Not Equal   |x != y
| >         |Greater than|x > y|
| <         |Less than|x < y|
| >=         |Greater than or equal to|x >= y|
| <=         |less than or equal to|x <= y|


### Python Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
|       Operator name          |     Name                   |example
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|&|AND            |Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1|
|       |OR   | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
| ^         |XOR |Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1|
| ~|NOT | Inverts all the bits
|<<      | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
|>>         |Signed right shift| Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
